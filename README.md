## My process

First I edited html, then moved on to css and finally javascript.
Html is mostly not that complicated to figure out. The only thing I think is hard s which tags to use. I give my best to use the propper tags.
I think css may be the hardest part to make work right so far. Sometimes it is difficult to determine proper width and height of elements but I think it will get easier with practise.
The hardest part about javascript (at least for me) is implementing logic. Sometimes a part of code will work, then another part will work but the first part won't so figuring out what's not right may be an issue. Of course there is lots of resoures on the internet but in the last few projects I learned that finding the right answer and asking the right question is also a skill which has to be learned.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

I think the most important thing I learned here was how functions actually work, or how the combination of multiple function works.
I think that there is a lot more to learn and with each new challenge I will learn something new. Right now I am not totaly sure of what I don't know beacuse with every challenge I solved there was also a realisation of things I didn't know before, so in the future I expect to get a grasp of things I'm currently not aware of. All in all this was a fun and challenging project. Another thing which happens on every project is every time when I struggle with something and walk away for a few minutes, hours or even whole night, the next time I sit to work the problem doesn't seem so hard and it actually seems pretty easy, so I think I will try to do this more often when I get stuck.
